/**
 * PipelineNews -> GridAtlas deep-link cartridge.
 *
 * Generation 202608312037. Successor to 202608291447-atlas-pointer-deep-link.mjs.
 * DRAFT - deployment: not-authorised. Review before promoting.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The predecessor emitted   /gridatlas/<release_id>/?repd_ref=<n>
 * which fails twice:
 *
 *   FAULT 1 - wrong path. The release is served at
 *             /gridatlas/atlas/releases/<release_id>/ and GridAtlas'
 *             atlas/current.json declares the stable route as /gridatlas/atlas/.
 *             The "atlas/" segment was missing, so every link 404s.
 *
 *             Note the predecessor's own invariant ASSERTED the broken shape:
 *               receiverUrl.pathname === `/gridatlas/${release_id}/`
 *             so correcting base_url alone would have thrown. Both had to move
 *             together, which is why this is a new cartridge and not an edit.
 *
 *   FAULT 2 - stripped payload. The link carried the reference alone, so the
 *             atlas had to resolve it by booting a 35.7 MB query engine before
 *             it could move the map. The known-good legacy link carries
 *             repd_ref + project + technology + capacity_mw + latitude +
 *             longitude + zoom and flies straight there, resolving nothing.
 *
 *             Every one of those fields is ALREADY in the compact project index
 *             (fields: repd_ref, gg_project_id, name, technology, status,
 *             capacity_mw, county, region, operator, repd_record_updated,
 *             geometry_status, latitude, longitude) and is ALREADY passed to
 *             this function by app.mjs. The predecessor simply ignored them.
 *             No data change, no schema change, no GridAtlas change.
 *
 * The eligibility gate already requires geometry_status === "valid", which is
 * exactly the guarantee that latitude and longitude are present. The contract
 * that makes the full payload safe was there all along.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE OPEN DECISION (priority item L-04)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two receivers accept the same parameters:
 *   "legacy" - globalgrid2050.com/repd_grid_atlasv8/  - proven, in use today
 *   "ported" - ventusltd.github.io/gridatlas/atlas/   - the migration target
 *
 * Change ACTIVE_TARGET below. That is the entire switch. Both are validated by
 * the same invariants, so neither can be selected in a broken state.
